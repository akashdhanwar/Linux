LINUX OS-
	Redhat, CentOS(Free Redhat), Fedora, Suse, Debian, Ubuntu
	
GUI of Linux is callef GNOME/KDE
Like Remote Desktop(RDP) in Windows, we have Putty in Linux or using ssh. For mac use ssh -l username IP.

FILE SYSTEM-
	/	/boot				-	files used by boot loader(grub.cfg)
		/root				-	root user home directory
		/dev				-	System(Peripheral) Devices(disk, cdrom, speakers, flashdrive, keyboard, etc)
		/etc				-	Configuration files
		/bin -> /usr/bin	-	Everyday user commands like ls 
		/sbin -> /usr/sbin	-	System/filesystem commands
		/opt				-	Optional/Third party add-on applications(Not part of OS apps)
		/proc				-	Running processes(Only exists in memory)
		/lib -> /usr/lib	-	C programming files needed by commands and apps. strace -e open pwd
		/tmp				-	Directory for temporary files
		/home				-	Normal user home directory
		/var				-	System logs
		/run				-	System daemons that start very early(eg- systemd and udev) to store temp runtime files like PID files
		/mnt				-	To mount external filesystems (eg- NFS)
		/media				-	For cdrom mounts

COMMANDS -
	man commandName	-	To get different options for a command

	whoami	-	To check who is logged in
	su -	-	Switch User
	clear	-	Clear Screen
	pwd		-	Print working directory
	cd		-	Change Directory. If we run only cd then we go to our default user directory
	ls -l	-	List. If starts with dash then it is a file, if starts with d then it is a folder. -ltr to sort descending order of creation

	touch First Second				-	Creates an empty file. Can create multiple files
	cp								-	Copy and create a file
	cp -R source_folder dest_folder	-	Copy folder
	vi								-	Editor for creating file. :wq! for write and quit
	echo "ok" > filename			-	Write data to file, >> to concat
	cat								-	Print file
	mkdir First Second				-	Make Directory. Can create multiple directories
	rm 								-	Remove or Delete file

	find location -name "Filename"	- 	find . -name "filename". find command dont have any database and uses filesyatem and hence slow
	locate filename					-	If no output then switch to root and type updatedb, run yum install mlocate. locate command has its own database and refreshes(updatedb command) and is faster
	passwd userid					-	Change Password, Enter old and new pw
	ln filename						-	Create link, -s for softlink

WHAT IS ROOT -
	Root Account is a username on linux machine
	Root as / directory or root directory
	Root home directory is /root

FILE STRUCTURE -
	drwxrwxrwx, number of links, Owner, Group, Size, Month, Day, Time, Name
 	Note -	7 Types of files in Linux
	 			d means directory 
				l means link
				dash means file 
				c means special/device file
				s means socket file
				p means named pipe file 
				b means blocked device file
	
WILDCARDS - can be used with any command
	*		-	represents zero or more characters
	?		-	represents single character
	[]		-	represents range of characters. Ex - ls -ltr *[cd]* gives files which have either c or d 
	{1..9}	-	represents range of characters. Ex - touch abc{1..9}-xyz creates 9 files
	\		-	as an escape character
	^		-	the beginning of the line
	$		-	the end of line

SOFT AND HARD LINKS(LIKE SHORTCUTS IN WINDOWS) -
	inode - Pointer or number of a file on the hard disk. (address of file)
	Soft link	-	link will be removed if file is removed/renamed. Command to create -> ln -s filename
	Hard link	-	link will not be removed. Command to create -> ln filename
	Note - 	We cannot create links in same directory with the same name
			Hardlinks work in same partition of harddrive
			ls -ltri filename -> to display inodes
Doubt - Why hardlink has -rw-rw-r-- instead of lrw-rw-r-- ?
